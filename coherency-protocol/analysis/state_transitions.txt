Low latency (couple tens of ns): state is exclusive
High latency (couple hundreds of ns): state is shared

SKX-24:

remote read, after local read : 20 ns -> exclusive (E/M)
local read                    : 58 ns -> shared (S/F)
local read, after remote read : 13 ns -> exclusive (E/M)
remote read                   : 13 ns -> exclusive (E/M)

CSX-48:

remote read, after local read : 29 ns -> exclusive (E/M)
local read                    : 64 ns -> shared (S/F)
local read, after remote read : 17 ns -> exclusive (E/M)
remote read                   : 16 ns -> exclusive (E/M)

ICX-48:
